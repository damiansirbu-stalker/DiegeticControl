[ Hero image: diegeticcontrol-hero.gif - per-source control of in-world sound ]

Thanks for the support, but I don't need donations. Reviews, ratings, and proper reports help more.
An organized group copies my work, spreads daily lies, and mass-downvotes my mods across platforms.
My work is open source, present in most modpacks, and integrates with established projects.

! After updating: MCM > Development > Reset ALL to Defaults !

Anomaly has no way to control the volume of radios, megaphones, guitars, and harmonicas independently from the game's audio sliders.
You can't turn down Duty propaganda without killing ambient sounds. DiegeticControl fixes this.

The mod hooks directly into the audio subsystems that play in-world sound: ph_sound for radios and megaphones, guitar_anim for campfire guitar, harmonica_anim for harmonica.
Each source gets its own volume slider, enable/disable toggle, and where applicable a pause multiplier that controls silence between tracks or announcements.

A master volume multiplier sits on top of everything. All changes apply immediately through MCM.

Missing dependencies are handled gracefully. If you don't have the guitar or harmonica mods installed, those controls do nothing.

Features:

Radios:
  Controls the volume of faction base radios and music
  Controls the pause between tracks, longer or shorter
  Enable/disable toggle

Megaphones:
  Controls the volume of Duty propaganda, the Arena announcer, and alarms
  Controls the pause between announcements
  Enable/disable toggle

Guitar:
  Volume control for campfire guitar (requires Guitar Animation mod)
  Enable/disable toggle

Harmonica:
  Volume control for harmonica (requires Harmonica mod)
  Enable/disable toggle

Master volume multiplier applied to all sources

Requirements:
Anomaly 1.5.3
Modded exes: themrdemonized 20250908 or newer, or AOEngine v0.55 or newer. The full feature set needs the latest demonized build. A feature that needs a newer one stays inactive on older exes.
xlibs (https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/xlibs-1001)
MCM
Radio_Remastered or similar provides the radio and megaphone sources
Guitar Animation by Daiviey provides the campfire guitar (optional)
Harmonica by Daiviey provides the harmonica (optional)

Configuration:
All settings in MCM under DiegeticControl. All defaults are 1.0 (unchanged from game behavior).

Compatibility:
Depends only on xlibs. Install and uninstall mid-save work. Tested: Anomaly 1.5.3, GAMMA, EFP, Zona, Forgotten Zone.
Everything else coexists, as long as it extends X-Ray and Anomaly and never overrides them.

How It's Built:

The code and patterns are original, built on best practices from the best STALKER modders and hands-on reverse-engineering of X-Ray.
The design stays engine-native and minimal, with event-native pub/sub not polling, work spread across frames via deferred queues and rate limiters, and per-level caches replacing world scans.
The raycasting and range math are hand-written and load-tested live, following the engine's own standards and flags.
Where scripting hits an engine limit, the fix is made in X-Ray itself, in the modded exes.
Performance is the first invariant, so every flow stays under 2ms or the build rewrites or drops it, profiled continuously with JitProfiler and hand-tested on unoptimized, single-threaded exes.
Every mod carries OpenTelemetry-style tracing and performance monitoring, spanning world events and every flow, gated by the log level so it costs nothing when off.
Every commit runs the full pipeline locally and in CI, with luacheck, a custom STALKER selene build, and a load test on engine stubs.
Rule layers then check Lua practice, engine truth, conventions, contracts, release, security, and docs.
Every rate, threshold, and toggle is exposed through MCM or LTX with nothing left hard-coded, and it writes no engine values, keeping its state within engine bounds so a save can never corrupt.
It runs on one xlibs rulebook shared across the whole mod family, the same protection, distances, faction logic, and combat reads in every mod.
It depends on no other mod, not even the author's own, and needs only X-Ray and xlibs beneath it.
See the Health and JitProfiler links up top for every test and smoke result, and the mod's real CPU and allocation cost.

Usage and License:
  Modpacks: allowed and encouraged. Keep the readme and license files.
  Addons, patches, integrations: allowed. Credit "DiegeticControl by Damian Sirbu" visibly on your mod page.
  Reproducing the implementation in other software: not allowed, even with credit.
  The full license is in the LICENSE file and on GitHub.

Diagnostics and reporting:
Every release goes through careful engineering and testing, but bugs can still slip through.
To report one, reproduce with debug logging on, and the world log where the mod has one.
First rule this mod out: reproduce with it off, then on. The cleanest test is this mod alone on vanilla and xlibs.
Send the traces on the Anomaly Discord, or file a defect on GitHub with the same information.
Attach xray.log, the mod log, the engine build, the modlist, and the load order.
For deep technical details and mechanisms, check the architecture docs on GitHub.
